    <p>This language learning app focuses on learning sentences that are relevant when traveling, i.e., ‘where is the nearest bathroom?’ or ‘do you know how to get to the museum from here?’ The app centers around communication rather than learning a new language from the very beginning.</p>

  <h1><b>The Brief</b></h1>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <p>I created a native language learning app that specifically focuses on tourists learning phrases they will most likely need to speak during their travel so they can communicate in the country’s native language.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <h2><b>Objective</b></h2>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <p> Provide sentences that will prepare users and locals for their trip.
      </p>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <h2><b>Problem</b></h2>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <p> How can a tourist communicate in a country’s native language without having to learn a whole new language?
        </p>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <h2><b>My role</b></h2>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <p> UX/UI Designer from research to conception, visualization, and testing.
          </p>
          <div></div>
          <div></div>
          <h2><b>Timeline</b></h2>
          <div></div>
          <div></div>
          <p> May - Aug 2020
            </p>

            <h2><b>The Challenge:</b></h2>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <p>Phrase will focus on teaching tourists basic, common phrases needed to travel when exploring a new city in a foreign country. The app will begin at teaching Spanish, French, German, and Japanese.
              </p>

      <h1><b>Understanding the User</b></h1>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <h2><b>User Personas and User Flow</b></h2>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <p>After I conducted user interviews to understand what participants like and dislike about current language apps, I created a user persona to help visualize a person who has certain goals and motivations to learn key phrases before going on a trip.

        </p>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <p>I created a user persona to help me visualize a different perspective and see how someone would be motivated to use the Phrase app and how it would be beneficial for them based on personal goals and lifestyle.

            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <p>After creating a user persona I created a user flow so I could see not only why Stephanie wants to use Phrase but also how she might navigate the app. The user flow proved to be extremely helpful in visualizing the flow of the app and having a visual reference that prepared me for prototyping.

                <h1><b>Prototyping</b></h1>
            <p>I wanted to sketch out prototyping on paper to visualize how wireframes would look based on the user flow I created above. I wanted to do a paper prototype just to throw together a quick sketch to help me comprehend the flow of the app.

                  <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
                  <div></div>
                  <div></div>
                  <p>I wanted to conduct a usability test to see how users interact with the prototype and identify any flaws or frustrations they found while exploring the concept. My main takeaway from the testing was that I should simplify the functions already provided. Here is an example of how I simplified as function after receiving that feedback:
                  </p>
                  <div></div>
                  <div></div>
                  <p>
                    “If i’m clicking my flashcard i expect to see my flashcard and maybe i don’t want to click twice to see them.”</p>
                    <div></div>
                    <div></div>
                  <p>“I want exercises I will be using a lot to be accessible on the Home page.”</p>
                  <div></div>
                  <div></div>
                  <p>After usability testing i found that users didn’t want so many steps before they reach their exercise so I created tabs at the top of the screen for users to tap the category with the ability to create a new flashcard or create multiple flashcards.
                  </p>
                  <div></div>
                  <div></div>
                  <h1><b>Iterations</b></h1>
                  <div></div>
                  <div></div>
                  <h2><b>Phrase Mockups </b></h2>
                  <p>After competitive analysis, user interviews, creating a proto- persona and user flow, prototyping, and eventually conducting a  usability test, I felt I had enough data and research to create a high-fidelity prototype that can be handed off to developers to show how the app works for the user and the functionality behind the app. Below are some examples of Phrase’s wireframes and a link to the full prototype:
                    </p>
                    <div></div>
                    <div></div>
                    <picture>
                      <source srcset="img/Phrase/vocabexercises.png">
                      <img src="img/Phrase/vocabexercises.png" alt= "Vocab Exercises">
                      </picture>
                      <div></div>
                      <div></div>
                    <p>In this high-fidelity prototype I polished the idea of the user selecting the answer based on three choices. Language,  Categories, and Spanish level are no longer asked before the exercise begins but as option user can select at the top of the screen.
                      </p>

                          <div></div>
                          <div></div>
                          <p>The user can create flashcards to practice their speech by typing a sentence they want to memorize and record themselves saying it with the ability to play it back and type what the sentence is from audio.
                          </p>
