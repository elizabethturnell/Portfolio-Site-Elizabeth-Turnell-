      <p> This scavenger hunt app called Spot focuses on tourists being able to explore any major city like a local with hunts created for tourists and written by locals. The app centers around exploring beloved neighborhoods that fit within the player’s budget, location, and personal interests.</p>

        <h3> The Brief </h3>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
        <p>I took on this case study to understand how scavenger hunt apps can be more beneficial to the travel community. Whenever I travel I try to understand the personality and unique quality of each city but the reality I have found is that without recommendations or advice from locals it is almost impossible to not end up in a restaurant full of tourists.</p>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <p>Objective: Gamify exploring a major city like a local.</p>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <p>Problem: How can a tourist explore a major city without having any local knowledge?</p>

  <h4> Understanding Scavenger Hunts</h4>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <p>To understand in which ways current scavenger hunts are successful and which ways they can be improved, I started my case study with observing competitors’ scavenger hunts apps and then conducting a survey to users of the apps. </p>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>

    <div></div>
    <p>I looked at two major competitors who also encourage travel and exploration through each hunt, Let’s Roam and Turf Hunt. Turf Hunt focuses on integrating hikes and outdoor activities into travel and Let’s Roam focuses on tourists visiting major tourist locations in major cities.
I broke down some of the main points I took away from my competitive analysis that I can focus on as I move forward with my case study.

<h6>User Interviews</h6>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p> Once I had a good understanding on the background of popular scavenger hunt apps, I wanted to understand what users like or dislike about playing scavenger hunts and what motivates them to continue playing. I prepared a user survey with 4 people between the ages of 18-40 that centered around answering four research goals:
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p> Understand user behavior around scavenger hunt apps
</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Determine what motivates users to complete a scavenger hunt
</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Document user pain points over existing city travel apps
</p>
