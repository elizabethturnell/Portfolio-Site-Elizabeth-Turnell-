      <p> This scavenger hunt app called Spot focuses on tourists being able to explore any major city like a local with hunts created for tourists and written by locals. The app centers around exploring beloved neighborhoods that fit within the player’s budget, location, and personal interests.</p>

        <h3> The Brief </h3>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
        <p>I took on this case study to understand how scavenger hunt apps can be more beneficial to the travel community. Whenever I travel I try to understand the personality and unique quality of each city but the reality I have found is that without recommendations or advice from locals it is almost impossible to not end up in a restaurant full of tourists.</p>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <p>Objective: Gamify exploring a major city like a local.</p>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <p>Problem: How can a tourist explore a major city without having any local knowledge?</p>
      <div></div>

        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <p>The Challenge: Spot will be accessible for anytime or place a player wants to go on a hunt based on their personal interests, budget, and location. The hunts can be used for any time of day unless they are a special hunt that includes a social gathering, in which case it will be denote Special Hunt at the top of the page.

  <h4> Understanding Scavenger Hunts</h4>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <p>To understand in which ways current scavenger hunts are successful and which ways they can be improved, I started my case study with observing competitors’ scavenger hunts apps and then conducting a survey to users of the apps. </p>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>

    <img src="img/Schnitzeljagd/compAnalysis.png" alt= "Competitive Analysis">
    </picture>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <p>I looked at two major competitors who also encourage travel and exploration through each hunt, Let’s Roam and Turf Hunt. Turf Hunt focuses on integrating hikes and outdoor activities into travel and Let’s Roam focuses on tourists visiting major tourist locations in major cities.
I broke down some of the main points I took away from my competitive analysis that I can focus on as I move forward with my case study.

<h6>User Interviews</h6>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p> Once I had a good understanding on the background of popular scavenger hunt apps, I wanted to understand what users like or dislike about playing scavenger hunts and what motivates them to continue playing. I prepared a user survey with 4 people between the ages of 18-40 that centered around answering four research goals:
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p> Understand user behavior around scavenger hunt apps
</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Determine what motivates users to complete a scavenger hunt
</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Document user pain points over existing city travel apps
</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Document user pain points over existing city travel apps
</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Collect data on the context in which users might use a scavenger hunt app for traveling.
</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h6> Analyzing User Research </h6>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h7> Affinity Mapping </h7>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p> After I collected data from my interviews I wanted to compile them into categories so I could see the similarities and differences based on each user. Once I could see how they research for travel, what habits they maintain around scavenger hunt apps, their needs/goals for going on hunts, and their frustrations with the apps I felt I had a better understanding of what users would want to see in a new scavenger hunt app.

        <h8>Creating Personas</h8>
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
        <p>Once I understood what users prefer in a scavenger hunt app I created two personas that would find themselves using Spot for separate reasons.  Creating user personas helped me put myself in a different perspective to see how someone else would navigate the app based on their location, time, and personal goals.

      <h1>Visualizing Flow of the App</h1>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <h2>Card Sorts & Site Mapping</h2>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
    <p>  Before I began prototyping I created a sitemap so i could visualize the flow of the app. After that I found 7 volunteers to do a card sort that led me to making a more direct sitemap that I used to begin my low-fidelity prototype.
    </p>

    <h1> Beginning to Prototype</h1>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <h2> Low Fidelity Prototyping </h2>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <p>After mapping out the flow of the app I sketched together some ideas on the layout of each screen. I created low-fidelity wireframes as a starting point of visualizing the elements and primary features of my app before moving on to mid-fidelity prototype.
    </p>

    <div></div>
    <h1>Mid-Fidelity Prototyping </h1>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <p> Now that I understood the general layout of each screen I focused on the content and how each action will help facilitate the user to completing a hunt in a simple and efficient manner. I conducted a usability test to see how comprehensive each screen is for the user.

    <div></div>
    <h1> Test & Iterate </h1>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <p>Based on the rainbow spreadsheet I narrowed down the top 5 issues with the mid-fidelity prototype and created a usability test plan to find solutions for the next phase.

<h1> Designing the App </h1>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h2>Design Documentation</h2>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Once I fixed the major issues users found in my mid-fidelity prototype due to my usability test plan, I felt confident in moving forward and focusing on the UI of the app and how I can present each screen as cohesive and accessible. I created a document of the icons, illustrations, font and font sizes, color palettes, button sizes, and the grid layout that will help facilitate the user’s journey
This documentation helped me remain on track but it will also be helpful for when I do a handoff to developers.

<h1> High-Fidelity Prototyping</h1>
<div></div>
<p>Now that I have collected all the data from my research, testing, and documentation, i’m ready to create my high-fidelity prototypes. High-fidelity prototyping is extremely useful to present as a final product because it integrates all the learnings from my case study and compiles each screen into how I believe the app will be most beneficial for the users. Additionally, it will be extremely helpful for handoff to developers because they will have a clear, concrete idea on what to create and how.Below you’ll see some key features i’ve created for the app with an explanation.
</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>These two mockups for onboarding will help filter out unnecessary hunts and provide hunts that fit within price range for the players.

<p>Home screen on mobile offers hunts based on user’s interests they selected in the onboarding process. The search engine encourages the user to continue exploring other options based on their daily preferences.

<p>When the hunt is selected by the user they are provided more detailed information on what to expect at each destination. Photos posted by other players are shown in carousel. The hunt also provides estimation of how much hunt will generally cost, the estimated duration of the hunt, and how far they will go from their starting point.

<h1>Preparing for Handoff</h1>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Now that I have reached a point in my case study where I feel confident I have a thorough understanding on my intentions and goals for this app based on the background research, prototyping, and documentation and can begin reach out to developers so Spot can be made into a tangible solution for travelers.

<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><b>some next steps will be </b></p>
